## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

![CJMotorcycles logo](assets/image/readme/readme-title.png)

_CJMotorcycles_ is a website for a business that my friend is looking at starting. I wanted to develop my JavaScript skills by building a website for the purpose of promoting my friends business and helping to meet his business' needs. After speaking to my friend about his business idea and having an in depth chat about what his goals for his business were, I thought this was a great idea for my milestone 2 project.

This was the second of four Milestone Projects required to pass the Full Stack Web Development Program at _Code Institute_. The main requirements were to build an interactive front-end site which responds to the users' actions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

## UX Design
### Design Process
#### Strategy Plane 
I started the design process for _CJMotorcycles_ by considering the goals of the site owner (my friend) and the site users (customers to the business). I summarised these using the following user stories:

_**Site owner**_
1. As the site owner, I want the site users to be able to navigate the site easily and find what they are looking for to ecourage them to return to the site in the future.
2. As the site owner, I want the website to be aesthetically pleasing and eye catching to allow for the business to stand out from the mass market and to create a positive and smooth experience for the site users.
3. As the site owner, I want the site to function well and incorporate features to help fulfill customer needs, allowing us to receive positive feedback and gain more popularity.

_**Site users**_
1. As a site user, I want to be able to navigate the site with ease and find what I'm looking for.
2. As a site user, I want the site to load quickly when navigating to different sections of the site.
3. As a site user, I want to be able to find the information I'm after without spending a lot of time on the site.
4. As a site user, I want to be reassured that I can place my trust in the business.
5. As a site user, I want to be able to contact the business directly from their site.
6. As a new site user, I want the website to clearly display what services the business offers.
7. As a new site user, I want to be able to find the address or contact details of the business.
8. As a new site user, I want to see past work or projects that the business has undertaken.
9. As a returning site user, I want the site to remember my choices when inputting data about my motorcycle.
10. As a returning site user, I want updates to garage opening days/times due to the current pandemic.

#### Scope Plane
After establishing the main aims of this project, I started looking for inspiration in similar business websites that already existed. I found this previous _Code Institue_ MS2 project particularly helpful, as it gave me a realistic idea of what I could achieve in a similar amount of time with a similar skill set:
- [Eternity by Chris Birrell](https://birrellc.github.io/Eternity-MS2/#home)

I also found these websites useful too:
- [Riders motorcycle group](https://www.ridersgroup.co.uk/)
- [CMC Bikes](https://www.cmcbikes.com/)

From my research and my user stories I defined the scope of my project by writing a list of “must-have” features and “nice-to-have” features that I wanted to include on my website.

_**"Must-haves"**_
1. The site must be aesthetically pleasing and have a consistent theme.
2. The site must be easy to navigate.
3. The site must load quickly and be responsive to user actions.
4. The site must allow user to input what engine size they have.
5. The site must give the customer instant feedback in regards to price for the engine size.
6. The site must have a clear and easy to use contact button and related form.
7. The site must demonstrate past projects and work undertaken.
8. The site must have contact information including a map of where the business is.
9. The site must allow the customer to change their selection of engine size without having to reload the page.
10. The site must inculde relevant social media links to their other profiles.

_**"Nice-to-haves"**_
1. The site could display current weather conditions and advisories on riding.
2. The site could allow the customer to be more specific about what bike they have rather than just engine size.
3. The site could allow for the user to book a motorcycle in for repair / service using an online booking system.

#### Structure Plane
Based on the features outlined in my scope and my research of other similar websites, I decided I wanted to keep it simple and include three pages on my website: ‘Home’, ‘About’ and ‘Services’. The ‘Home’ page welcomes the user to the website and gives the customer a breif overview of what services are offered. The ‘About’ page contains information about the business, including experience and why they are the right business for the job. It also includes a meet the team section, giving an insight to the mechanics and what experience and skill set each member of the team has. The ‘Services’ page, by far the most complex and content filled page, contains concise information about what services are offered. Theres also a section to allow the customer to input their engine size and the page will tell them how much for an engine service. All pages will be lined with the same header and footer, allowing easy access to navigate to the other pages and with contact information and a map of where the business is, located in the footer.
