## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

![CJMotorcycles logo](assets/image/readme/readme-title.png)

_CJMotorcycles_ is a website for a business that my friend is looking at starting. I wanted to develop my JavaScript skills by building a website for the purpose of promoting my friends business and helping to meet his business' needs. After speaking to my friend about his business idea and having an in depth chat about what his goals for his business were, I thought this was a great idea for my milestone 2 project.

This was the second of four Milestone Projects required to pass the Full Stack Web Development Program at _Code Institute_. The main requirements were to build an interactive front-end site which responds to the users' actions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
