## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

![CJMotorcycles logo](assets/image/readme/readme-title.png)

_CJMotorcycles_ is a website for a business that my friend is looking at starting. I wanted to develop my JavaScript skills by building a website for the purpose of promoting my friends business and helping to meet his business' needs. After speaking to my friend about his business idea and having an in depth chat about what his goals for his business were, I thought this was a great idea for my milestone 2 project.

This was the second of four Milestone Projects required to pass the Full Stack Web Development Program at _Code Institute_. The main requirements were to build an interactive front-end site which responds to the users' actions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

## UX Design
### Design Process
#### Strategy Plane 
I started the design process for _CJMotorcycles_ by considering the goals of the site owner (my friend) and the site users (customers to the business). I summarised these using the following user stories:

_**Site owner**_
1. As the site owner, I want the site users to be able to navigate the site easily and find what they are looking for to ecourage them to return to the site in the future.
2. As the site owner, I want the website to be aesthetically pleasing and eye catching to allow for the business to stand out from the mass market and to create a positive and smooth experience for the site users.
3. As the site owner, I want the site to function well and incorporate features to help fulfill customer needs, allowing us to receive positive feedback and gain more popularity.
